Optimization Hints:
- **Tiling** (T) decomposes a matrix into smaller blocks to improve memory access.
- **Reordering** (R) exchanges a for-loops to boost memory access efficiency.
- **Vectorization** (V) packs matrix data to use vector instructions for computation and memory access.
- **Layout** (L) rearranges matrix data to better fit the hardwareâ€™s memory access patterns.
- **Pipeline** (P) overlaps the computation and memory access to minimize the memory access latency.

Task:
Use the extracted context from the hardware manuals, to extract the Optimization Hints for the given Hardware platform and generate a report with the details on how to optimize the kernel for all the different types of optimization hints.
In case the context is not sufficient, use your own knowledge of the hardware infrastructure to generate the output, do not output anything else.
